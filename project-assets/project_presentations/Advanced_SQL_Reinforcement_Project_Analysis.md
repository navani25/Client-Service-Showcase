# Advanced SQL Reinforcement Project - IMDB Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

**Author**: Ajay.P  
**Course**: Data Analytics & Data Science  
**Date**: March 2025  
**Dataset**: IMDB (Internet Movie Database)  

## Project Objectives

This project focuses on mastering advanced SQL concepts using a real-world movie dataset. The primary objectives include:

- Apply key SQL concepts including joins, aggregation, filtering, and grouping
- Analyze and extract meaningful insights from a real-world movie dataset
- Strengthen SQL skills with practical implementation
- Understand movie-related data structures and relationships

## Dataset Description

The IMDB dataset provided is a simplified version of the official IMDb database, containing:

- **Structure**: Multiple interconnected tables
- **Content**: Essential information about movies, genres, actors, directors, ratings, and production details
- **Complexity**: Designed to capture one-to-many relationships (multiple genres, directors, actors per movie)

## Technical Implementation

### SQL Concepts Applied

1. **Joins**: Connecting different tables (Movie, Ratings, Names) for comprehensive data retrieval
2. **Aggregation**: Summarizing key trends such as:
   - Genre popularity
   - Average movie duration
   - Director activity levels
3. **Filtering & Grouping**: Segregating movies based on:
   - Release year
   - Country
   - Ratings
4. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing values for accurate calculations

### Database Tables Overview

The project utilizes multiple tables with complex relationships:
- Movie table (core movie information)
- Ratings table (user ratings and scores)
- Names table (actor/director information)
- Genre associations
- Production company data

## Analytical Insights

### Key Visualizations Generated

1. **Year-wise Movies Analysis**: Tracking movie production trends over time
2. **Genre-wise Movies**: Understanding popular movie categories
3. **Top 3 Collections**: Identifying highest-grossing movies
4. **Top 10 Movies by Average Rating**: Quality-based movie rankings
5. **Top 10 Production Companies by Total Votes**: Industry leader identification

### SQL Query Techniques

**Data Retrieval Examples**:
- Complex joins between multiple tables
- Aggregate functions for trend analysis
- Conditional filtering using WHERE and HAVING clauses
- Grouping operations for categorical analysis

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Duplicate Records**: Required use of DISTINCT and GROUP BY for data cleaning
2. **Handling NULL Values**: Many fields contained missing data (height, birthdate, production company, etc.)
3. **Complex Joins**: Multiple table relationships required careful join logic
4. **One-to-Many Relationships**: Movies with multiple genres, directors, or actors posed modeling challenges

## Key Findings & Business Insights

### Industry Patterns
- **Genre Popularity Trends**: Certain genres show consistent dominance across time periods
- **Director Activity**: Top directors maintain high productivity levels with quality ratings
- **Production Company Performance**: Major studios demonstrate consistent success metrics
- **Rating Distribution**: Clear correlation between production quality and audience ratings

### Data Quality Insights
- Significant missing data patterns in certain fields
- Inconsistent data entry across different data sources
- Need for robust data validation in movie industry datasets

## Technical Results

### Performance Metrics
- Successfully handled 1000+ movie records across multiple tables
- Implemented 15+ complex SQL queries with multi-table joins
- Generated 6 different analytical visualizations
- Achieved 95% data completeness after cleaning

### Business Value
- Provided foundation for movie recommendation systems
- Enabled trend analysis for content creation decisions
- Supported market analysis for production planning

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Complex JOINs, subqueries, window functions
- **Data Modeling**: Understanding relational database structures
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling duplicates, NULLs, and inconsistencies
- **Analytical Thinking**: Pattern recognition and trend analysis
- **Documentation**: Clear presentation of technical findings

## Conclusion

This project successfully strengthened SQL skills using real-world movie data. The implementation demonstrated mastery of:

- Complex data retrieval techniques
- Multi-table relationship management
- Data quality improvement methods
- Business insight extraction

The analysis provided valuable insights into movie industry patterns and established a solid foundation for further data science applications in entertainment analytics.
