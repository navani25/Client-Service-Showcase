SQL OVERVIEW
SQL OVERVIEW

WHICH  SQL MATTERS I USED  IN THIS PROJECT :-

Joins:     Connecting different tables (Movie, Ratings, Names) for comprehensive data retrieval. 

Aggregation:   Summarizing key trends such as genre popularity, average movie duration, and director activity. 

Filtering & Grouping: Segregating movies based on their release year, country, and ratings to find patterns. 

Data Cleaning: Identifying missing values and ensuring accurate calculations.

CHALLENGES FACED :-
CHALLENGES FACED :-

DUBLICATE  RECORDS : you may need  distinct , group by to clean this.

HANDLING NULLS : many fields (e.g., height ,birthdate , production company , etc..)
 
COMPLEX JOINS BETWEEN TABLES : required to gather data across multiple tables.

ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS : a movie may have multiple genre ,directors , or actors.
