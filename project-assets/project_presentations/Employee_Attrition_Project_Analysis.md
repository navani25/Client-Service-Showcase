- Training and development participation

## Data Quality & Preparation

### Data Cleaning Framework

**Missing Value Treatment**:
- Comprehensive audit of missing data in:
  - Age demographics
  - Daily rate information
  - Distance from home data
  - Business travel requirements
  - Marital status records

**Data Transformation Process**:
1. **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables for analytical processing
2. **Normalization**: Standardize numerical scales across variables
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create derived metrics for enhanced analysis
4. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminate redundant or irrelevant records

### DAX Implementation for Advanced Analytics

**Custom Measures Created**:

```dax
-- Age Group Analysis
Age Group = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    Employees[Age] < 25, "Young Professional",
    Employees[Age] < 35, "Mid-Career",
    Employees[Age] < 45, "Senior Professional",
    "Executive Level"
)

-- Average Income by Demographics
Avg Income = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Employees[MonthlyIncome]),
    FILTER(Employees, Employees[Attrition] = "No")
)

-- Overtime Impact Analysis
Overtime Attrition Rate = 
CALCULATE(
    DIVIDE(
        CALCULATE(COUNT(Employees[EmployeeID]), 
                 Employees[Attrition] = "Yes" && Employees[OverTime] = "Yes"),
        CALCULATE(COUNT(Employees[EmployeeID]), 
                 Employees[OverTime] = "Yes")
    )
)
```

## Advanced Analytics & Insights

### Key Attrition Drivers Identified

1. **Overtime Impact**: 
   - Direct correlation between overtime frequency and attrition risk
   - Employees working overtime show significantly higher turnover rates
   - Recommendation: Implement work-life balance programs

2. **Job Satisfaction Correlation**:
   - Strong negative relationship between job satisfaction and attrition
   - Low satisfaction scores predict higher likelihood of departure
   - Action Item: Enhanced employee engagement initiatives

3. **Work-Life Balance Factor**:
   - Critical retention indicator across all demographics
   - Poor work-life balance linked to increased attrition
   - Strategy: Flexible working arrangements and wellness programs

4. **Role-Specific Turnover Patterns**:
   - Certain job roles exhibit higher natural turnover rates
   - Sales and customer-facing roles show elevated attrition
   - Mitigation: Role-specific retention strategies and career development

### Demographic Analysis Insights

**Age-Based Patterns**:
- Younger employees (<30) show higher mobility preferences
- Mid-career employees (30-45) prioritize stability and growth
- Senior employees (>45) demonstrate lower attrition rates

**Income Segmentation**:
- Clear correlation between compensation levels and retention
- Middle-income employees show optimal retention patterns
- Premium compensation doesn't guarantee retention without other factors
