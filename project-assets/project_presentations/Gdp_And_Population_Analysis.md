Key insights :-
Key insights :-

Oceania has the highest population growth rate (382,352).

Andorra (19000) has the highest and Saint Helena (2500) the lowest GDP per capita.

Infant mortality is significantly lower in high-income regions.

Western Europe (3,989.70) has the highest and North America (0.00) the lowest population density.

GDP growth strongly correlates with literacy rates in most regions
