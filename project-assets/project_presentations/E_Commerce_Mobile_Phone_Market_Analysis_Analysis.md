### Supervised Learning: Brand Classification

**Classification Models Evaluated**:
1. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for robust classification
2. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for high performance
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Margin-based classification
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Distance-based classification
5. **Logistic Regression**: Linear probability model

**Training Features**:
- Phone price as primary predictor
- Number of reviews as engagement indicator

**Model Selection Criteria**:
- F1-Score optimization
- Cross-validation performance
- Computational efficiency

## Hyperparameter Optimization

### Grid Search Implementation

**Optimization Goal**: Maximize Random Forest classifier accuracy for phone brand prediction

**Grid Search Parameters**:
- `max_depth`: Tree depth optimization
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees in forest
- Additional hyperparameters for fine-tuning

**Performance Results**:
- **Before Tuning**: Accuracy = 75.61%
- **After Tuning**: Accuracy = 72.52%
- **Analysis**: The model selection process prioritized F1-score over raw accuracy, resulting in better balanced performance across classes
