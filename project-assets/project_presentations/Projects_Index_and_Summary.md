# Cross-Project Analytical Portfolio: Objectives, Methods, Tools, Findings, and Business Impact

## Executive Summary & Portfolio Objectives

This portfolio comprises eight analytical projects that collectively demonstrate end-to-end capabilities across data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and applied machine learning. The projects span e-commerce market analysis, workforce analytics, macroeconomic and demographic analysis, consumer pricing intelligence, entertainment industry insights, and operational sales analytics. Despite diverse domains, each project follows a consistent analytical arc: from source data and data preparation, through metric development and visualization, to actionable insights and business recommendations.

Tooling consolidates around Excel, Power BI (including DAX), Tableau, SQL, Python (including Selenium, BeautifulSoup, SQLAlchemy), and MySQL. Across projects, the narrative moves from the what (the dataset and objectives) to the how (the methods and tools) and finally to the so what (business insights and recommendations). While strong patterns emerge—segmentation, KPI-driven dashboards, hyperparameter tuning—there are material gaps in quantitative performance metrics for several projects, limiting comparability and benchmarking. Addressing these gaps is central to the roadmap for stronger evidence-based decision-making.

To ground the overview, Table 1 summarizes the portfolio at a glance.

Strengths of the portfolio include end-to-end pipeline construction (web scraping to modeling), multi-tool fluency, KPI-centric dashboards, and actionable insights spanning workforce retention, market segmentation, macroeconomic development, compensation equity, consumer pricing, and sales optimization. However, quantitative rigor is uneven: several projects lack model metrics, sample sizes, or methodology specifics, which constrains comparability and confidence.

## Cross-Project Methodology & Tools Landscape

A consistent methodology underpins the projects:

- Acquisition: web scraping (e-commerce), simulated datasets (entertainment), enterprise files (Excel/CSV), and SQL sources.
- Cleaning: removal of duplicates, handling missing values, outlier treatment (e.g., IQR for price), standardization of types and categories.
- Feature engineering: brand/model extraction, banded KPIs, computed DAX measures (growth rates, per capita, aggregations).
- Analysis: exploratory analysis, segmentation (e.g., K-Means with k=4), classification model testing (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression), dashboard storytelling with slicers and cross-filtering.
- Visualization: Excel PivotTables and charts, Power BI dashboards with DAX measures, Tableau KPI cards, Pareto, trend lines, heat maps, and geo-mapping.

The tool-by-project matrix below consolidates observed roles. Where the source mentions a tool but not its role, “unspecified” is noted.

## Project Portfolio Deep Dives

### Advanced SQL Reinforcement (IMDB)

Objectives centered on strengthening core SQL skills—joins, aggregation, filtering, and grouping—using a simplified IMDB schema covering movies, ratings, names, and related entities. The methodology emphasized multi-table joins, aggregation for genre and director activity, filtering by year/country/ratings, and handling data quality issues such as duplicates and nulls. Visual insights include year-wise and genre-wise counts, top movies by average rating, top production companies by total votes, and top collections.

Key findings reinforce SQL proficiency and structured understanding of movie data relationships. The project effectively surfaces genre popularity, director activity, and company engagement patterns. However, business interpretability is constrained by the absence of specific KPI tables, query outputs, and performance benchmarks.

Technical details to strengthen future iterations include: a full ERD and table glossary; representative query inventory with execution plans; deduplication rules; null-handling policies; and quantitative metrics (e.g., top-N query runtimes, rows processed). This would improve repeatability and enable performance tuning.

### E-Commerce Mobile Phone Market Analysis

This end-to-end pipeline applied Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape 1,161 product records across 40 pages of a leading e-commerce site. The flow proceeded through cleaning, EDA, unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and hyperparameter tuning. Cleaning included duplicate removal, missing value treatment, feature engineering (brand/model extraction), and type conversions, with IQR-based outlier handling for price. SQLAlchemy was used for persistence of cleaned data, indicating attention to data governance.

For unsupervised learning, K-Means clustering (k=4, chosen via silhouette score) grouped products by price, rating, and reviews to support targeted marketing and positioning. For supervised learning, brand classification was tested across five algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, K-NN, Logistic Regression) with XGBoost selected based on the highest F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was applied to a Random Forest classifier, reporting an “Accuracy Before Tuning” of 0.7561 and an “Accuracy After Tuning (Best Score)” of 0.7252. While the stated goal was to maximize accuracy, the observed post-tuning score is lower than the pre-tuning value, signaling potential overfitting in the search, a mis-specified parameter grid, or data leakage—issues that warrant cross-validation and a holdout test to confirm.

To clarify the modeling steps and performance, the following tables summarize model selection and tuning results.

Table 3. Model comparison overview (classification)
| Algorithm | Role | Metric Reported | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | Baseline | Accuracy | 0.7561 (before tuning) |
| XGBoost | Best model | F1-score | Selected as best (value not provided) |
| SVM | Comparative | Not specified | Tested |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Comparative | Not specified | Tested |
| Logistic Regression | Comparative | Not specified | Tested |

Table 4. Tuning summary for Random Forest
| Metric | Before Tuning | After Tuning | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.7561 | 0.7252 | Lower post-tuning score; investigate CV and validation |

The project’s full-pipeline approach and segmentation are strong. The business impact lies in market segmentation and brand classification for marketing strategy. Next steps should incorporate more product specifications (RAM, processor), time-series analyses, and robust validation to establish model generalization.

### Employee Attrition Project

The HR analytics project targeted identification of attrition drivers using Power BI, Excel, and DAX on a dataset with 1,029 employee records across 35 features. Cleaning addressed missing values, categorical encoding, normalization, and duplicate removal. DAX measures supported demographic, job, compensation, and behavioral analyses. Interactive dashboards enabled exploration across age groups, income categories, and work-life balance factors.

Key findings indicate that overtime correlates with higher attrition, low job satisfaction drives turnover, and work-life balance and training support retention; certain roles exhibit higher turnover. The analytic approach is directionally sound and actionable. To enhance rigor, the project should include a formal predictive model (e.g., logistic regression or tree-based classification) with AUC/ROC and precision-recall metrics, plus a feature importance analysis to quantify driver strength.

Table 5. Attrition driver overview
| Driver | Directional Impact | Evidence/Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Overtime | Increases attrition | Dashboard patterns and DAX measures indicate higher turnover among overtime-eligible employees |
| Job satisfaction | Low satisfaction increases attrition | Interactive filters and KPI cards align with findings |
| Work-life balance | Improves retention | Patterns suggest better retention where balance is higher |
| Role-specific turnover | Varies by job role | Departmental comparisons highlight roles with elevated turnover |

### GDP & Population Analysis

Sourcing data from SQL and Excel, this macroeconomic dashboard examined population, GDP, literacy, and infant mortality, with DAX measures for growth rates and per capita metrics. Visual features include region list slicers, dual charts for population and GDP, and KPI cards. The analysis highlights regional disparities, growth trends from 1960–2017, and relationships between GDP and development indicators.

Key insights include Oceania’s high population growth, Andorra leading GDP per capita while Saint Helena is lowest, lower infant mortality in high-income regions, stark differences in population density, and a strong correlation between GDP growth and literacy. The storytelling effectively frames policy implications for high-income versus developing regions.

Table 6. Indicator-to-insight mapping
| Indicator | Insight | Region Examples |
|---|---|---|
| GDP per capita | Highest in Andorra, lowest in Saint Helena | Western Europe vs. North America |
| Infant mortality | Lower in high-income regions | Global cross-regional contrast |
| Population density | Western Europe highest; North America lowest | Regional averages |
| GDP–literacy correlation | Strong positive relationship across regions | Most regions |

### Laptop Price Analysis

A consumer electronics pricing study with 1,303 entries and 12 attributes (e.g., brand, type, screen, CPU, RAM, memory, GPU, OS, weight, price) applied mode-based missing value imputation, IQR outlier handling, and standardization. Feature engineering supported univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses and market segmentation.

Findings indicate that premium brands and specs—higher RAM/SSD, newer CPUs, dedicated GPUs—drive price. Advanced display features (touchscreen, IPS, high resolution) and lightweight designs add significant value. The market segments into Premium, Balanced, and Budget tiers. Recommendations include focusing on lightweight, premium-display, and gaming models, marketing CPU, RAM/SSD, and brand reliability, and implementing clear pricing tiers. The feature importance and regression metrics are not provided; adding these would materially strengthen decision confidence.

### Salary Survey 2021

Compensation analytics covered 28,084 records with fields for job title, salary, country, experience, education, and gender. Cleaning removed nulls and extreme outliers, standardized salaries to USD, and created a total compensation metric (base plus bonuses). Analyses used Excel PivotTables and charts, with data imported into MySQL for querying.

Key findings show higher education boosts earning potential, persistent gender pay gaps across roles and industries, normalization of remote work with competitive compensation, and interactive dashboards enabling fast insights for HR teams. Causal analysis is limited, but directional insights support pay transparency and equity initiatives. Adding regression and decomposition methods (e.g., Oaxaca-Blinder) would quantify the unexplained pay gap.

Table 7. Dimension vs. compensation patterns (qualitative)
| Dimension | Directional Insight |
|---|---|
| Education | Higher levels correlate with higher earnings |
| Gender | Gaps persist across roles and industries |
| Experience | Positive correlation with compensation |
| Remote work | Increasing normalization with competitive pay |

### Sales Analyst – Advanced Excel

Operational sales analytics used the Superstore Sales dataset (~10,000 rows), with cleaning for duplicates and invalid values and proper formatting for dates and currency. The methodology included PivotTables, charts, dynamic dashboards, What-If analysis, Goal Seek, Scenario Manager, and VBA automation.

Insights highlight strong performance in the Technology category and Standard Class shipping, clear seasonal trends in November–December, and the need to optimize discount policy and improve low-performing areas. Next steps include predictive modeling and deeper customer analysis. The approach is practical and aligned with day-to-day commercial decision-making.

Table 8. Insight-to-recommendation mapping
| Insight | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Technology category performs best | Focus inventory and promotions on this segment | Higher margins and sales velocity |
| Standard Class shipping optimal | Prioritize cost-effective shipping modes | Improved profitability |
| Seasonal peak in Nov–Dec | Plan inventory and campaigns ahead of peak | Reduced stockouts; maximized seasonal revenue |
| Discount policy optimization | Calibrate discounts to protect margins | Improved net profitability |

### Tableau: Entertainment Industry Analysis

A simulated entertainment dataset (Mockaroo) with attributes for title, genre, platform, country, region, revenue, budget, profit, release date, download count, and awards enabled KPI cards and advanced visualizations—map charts, Pareto charts, trend lines, and heat maps—supported by dynamic filters for region, platform, genre, and year.

Key insights report massive scale—revenue of ₹508B and profit of ₹503B—with strong audience engagement (54M+ ticket sales; 50M+ downloads). The dashboard supports region-specific promotion, budget optimization, and platform targeting. As a simulation, external validation and benchmark alignment would be beneficial.

Table 9. KPI summary and visualization references
