### Custom Economic Indicators

```dax
-- Population Growth Rate Calculation
Population Growth Rate = 
VAR CurrentPopulation = SUM(EconomicData[Population])
VAR PreviousPopulation = CALCULATE(SUM(EconomicData[Population]), 
                                  PREVIOUSYEAR(EconomicData[Year]))
RETURN
DIVIDE(CurrentPopulation - PreviousPopulation, PreviousPopulation) * 100

-- GDP per Capita Calculation
GDP per Capita = 
DIVIDE(SUM(EconomicData[GDP]), SUM(EconomicData[Population]), 0)

-- Regional Economic Performance
Regional GDP Index = 
VAR RegionalGDP = CALCULATE(SUM(EconomicData[GDP]), 
                           ALL(EconomicData[Country]))
VAR TotalGDP = SUM(EconomicData[GDP])
RETURN
DIVIDE(RegionalGDP, TotalGDP) * 100

-- Economic Development Score
Development Index = 
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(EconomicData, EconomicData[Country] = EARLIER(EconomicData[Country])),
    EconomicData[GDP per Capita] * 0.4 + 
    EconomicData[Literacy Rate] * 0.3 + 
    (100 - EconomicData[Infant Mortality Rate]) * 0.3
)
```
